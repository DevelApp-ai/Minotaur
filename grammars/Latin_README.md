## Core Features

### 1. Five-Declension Noun System

Latin nouns decline through six cases in five different declension patterns:

#### Cases
1. **Nominative**: Subject of the verb
2. **Genitive**: Possession ("of")
3. **Dative**: Indirect object ("to/for")
4. **Accusative**: Direct object
5. **Ablative**: Various uses (means, accompaniment, time, place)
6. **Vocative**: Direct address (usually same as nominative)

#### Five Declensions

**First Declension** (mostly feminine) - *puella, puellae* (girl)
- Singular: puella, puellae, puellae, puellam, puella
- Plural: puellae, puellarum, puellis, puellas, puellis

**Second Declension** (masculine/neuter) - *dominus, domini* (master) / *bellum, belli* (war)
- Masculine: dominus, domini, domino, dominum, domino

- Plural forms follow similar patterns

**Third Declension** (all genders) - *rex, regis* (king) / *corpus, corporis* (body)

### 2. Four Conjugation Verb System

Latin verbs conjugate through four patterns across multiple tenses, voices, and moods.

#### Four Conjugations

### 3. Adjective System

#### Agreement
Adjectives agree with nouns in:
- **Gender** (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- **Number** (singular, plural)
- **Case** (all six cases)

#### Declension Patterns
Most adjectives follow 1st/2nd declension pattern:
- *bonus, bona, bonum* (good)
- Masculine like 2nd declension nouns
- Feminine like 1st declension nouns
- Neuter like 2nd declension neuters

Some adjectives follow 3rd declension patterns.

#### Comparison

**Positive**: *fortis* (brave)

**Comparative**: *fortior, fortius* (braver, more brave)
- Formed with *-ior* (m/f), *-ius* (n)
- Declined like 3rd declension

**Superlative**: *fortissimus, fortissima, fortissimum* (bravest, most brave)
- Formed with *-issimus, -issima, -issimum*
- Declined like 1st/2nd declension adjectives

Irregular comparisons:
- *bonus, melior, optimus* (good, better, best)
- *malus, peior, pessimus* (bad, worse, worst)
- *magnus, maior, maximus* (great, greater, greatest)
- *parvus, minor, minimus* (small, smaller, smallest)

### 4. Pronoun System

#### Personal Pronouns
- **1st person**: ego (I), nos (we)
- **2nd person**: tu (you sing.), vos (you pl.)
- **3rd person**: is, ea, id (he, she, it) - also demonstrative

#### Demonstrative Pronouns
- **hic, haec, hoc**: this (near speaker)
- **ille, illa, illud**: that (distant)
- **is, ea, id**: that, he/she/it
- **ipse, ipsa, ipsum**: -self (intensive)

#### Relative Pronouns
- **qui, quae, quod**: who, which, that
- Declined for gender, number, and case
- Agrees with antecedent in gender/number
- Case determined by function in relative clause

#### Reflexive Pronouns
- **se**: himself, herself, themselves
- Used when subject and object refer to same person

#### Interrogative Pronouns
- **quis, quid**: who? what?
- **qui, quae, quod**: which? what?

### 5. Word Order

Latin word order is highly flexible due to case endings showing grammatical relationships.

#### Default Order: SOV (Subject-Object-Verb)
- "Puella librum legit" (The girl the book reads = The girl reads the book)

#### Common Variations
- Emphasis by position (first or last)
- Poetry uses very free word order
- Prose tends toward standard patterns
- New information typically at end

#### Topicalization
Any element can be fronted for emphasis or topic marking.

### 6. Prepositional System

#### Accusative Prepositions
Express motion toward or direction:
- **ad**: to, toward, at
- **ante**: before, in front of
- **apud**: at, near, among

### 7. Subordinate Clauses

#### Purpose Clauses
- **ut** + subjunctive: in order that, so that
- **ne** + subjunctive: lest, in order that...not

#### Result Clauses
- **ut** + subjunctive (with *tam, ita, sic*): that, so that

#### Indirect Commands
- **ut/ne** + subjunctive: to/not to (after verbs of commanding, urging)

#### Cum Clauses
- **cum** + subjunctive: when, since, although (circumstantial, causal, concessive)
- **cum** + indicative: when (temporal)

#### Conditional Sentences
- **si** + indicative: if (simple conditions)
- **si** + subjunctive: if (contrary to fact, future less vivid)

#### Relative Clauses
- Introduced by relative pronouns (*qui, quae, quod*)
- Can take subjunctive for purpose or characteristic

### 8. Ablative Absolute

A uniquely Latin construction consisting of:
- Noun/pronoun in ablative case
- Participle (or adjective/noun) in ablative case
- Grammatically independent from rest of sentence
- Translates as subordinate clause in English

**Examples:**
- "Caesare duce" (Caesar being leader = With Caesar as leader)
- "Urbe capta" (The city having been captured)
- "His rebus gestis" (These things having been done)

### 9. Indirect Discourse

Latin uses infinitive constructions for indirect statements:
- Main verb of saying/thinking
- Accusative subject of infinitive
- Infinitive for the verb

**Example:**
- "Dicit Marcum venire" (He says that Marcus is coming)
- Literally: "He says Marcus to come"

### 10. Adverb System

#### Types of Adverbs

**Time**: nunc (now), tunc (then), hodie (today), heri (yesterday), cras (tomorrow), semper (always), numquam (never)

**Place**: hic (here), ibi (there), ubi (where), quo (whither), unde (whence)

**Manner**: bene (well), male (badly), celeriter (quickly), lente (slowly), fortiter (bravely)

**Degree**: valde (very), multum (much), parum (little), nimis (too much), tam (so), quam (as)

#### Formation
Many adverbs formed from adjectives:
- 1st/2nd declension adjectives: *-e* (laetus → laete)
- 3rd declension adjectives: *-iter* (fortis → fortiter)

#### Comparison of Adverbs
- Positive: *fortiter* (bravely)
- Comparative: *fortius* (more bravely) - same as neuter comparative adjective
- Superlative: *fortissime* (most bravely)

## Context-Sensitive Validation

The grammar includes validation rules for:

1. **Adjective-noun case agreement**: Adjectives must match nouns in case
2. **Adjective-noun gender agreement**: Adjectives must match nouns in gender
3. **Adjective-noun number agreement**: Adjectives must match nouns in number
4. **Subject-verb agreement**: Subjects and verbs should agree in number
5. **Preposition case governance**: Prepositions govern specific cases
6. **Subjunctive mood usage**: Warnings for subordinate clauses
