## Unique Bulgarian Features

### 1. No Case System
Unlike other Slavic languages, Bulgarian has lost the case system:
- **No declensions**: книга (book) remains same in all syntactic positions
- **Prepositions** handle relationships: в книгата (in the book), от книгата (from the book)
- Simplifies grammar compared to Russian, Polish, Czech

### 2. Definite Article Suffixes
Definite articles are suffixed to nouns (unique among Slavic):
- **Masculine**: човек → човекът (the man)
- **Feminine**: книга → книгата (the book)
- **Neuter**: дете → детето (the child)
- **Plural**: хора → хората (the people)

### 3. Three Past Tenses
Bulgarian distinguishes three past tenses:
- **Aorist** (perfective, simple past): прочетох (I read-completed)
- **Imperfect** (imperfective, ongoing past): четях (I was reading)
- **Perfect** (compound): съм чел (I have read)

### 4. Да-Construction
Universal construction for subjunctive, imperative, and purpose:
- **Subjunctive**: Искам да чета (I want to read)
- **Imperative**: Да четеш! (Read!)
- **Purpose**: Дойдох да те видя (I came to see you)

### 5. Clitic Pronoun Doubling
Object pronouns can be doubled with full noun phrases:
- **Казах му на Иван** (lit. "I-told him to Ivan")
