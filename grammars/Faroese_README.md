## Linguistic Notes

### Preservation of Old Norse
Faroese has preserved many features of Old Norse that have been simplified in other Scandinavian languages:
- Four-case system (like Icelandic, unlike Danish/Swedish/Norwegian)
- Three grammatical genders
- Complex verb conjugation with person marking
- Rich vowel system with diphthongs

### Phonology
Faroese orthography differs significantly from pronunciation:
- Written "ae" often pronounced [ɛa] or [œa]
- "ó" pronounced [ɔu]
- "ú" pronounced [ʉu]
- Pre-aspiration of voiceless stops

### Diglossia
Faroese exists in a diglossic situation with Danish, though Faroese has been the primary language of education since 1938. Many technical and administrative terms are borrowed from Danish.
