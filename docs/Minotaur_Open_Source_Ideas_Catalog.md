**Technical Implementation Ideas**:
```typescript
interface GrammarHighlightEngine {
  // Real-time highlighting as user types
  tokenizeContent(content: string, grammar: ParsedGrammar): SyntaxToken[];
  
  // Grammar rule-based highlighting
  getHighlightingRules(grammar: ParsedGrammar): HighlightRule[];
  
  // Performance-optimized incremental highlighting
  incrementalHighlight(changes: TextChange[], tokens: SyntaxToken[]): SyntaxToken[];
}
```
