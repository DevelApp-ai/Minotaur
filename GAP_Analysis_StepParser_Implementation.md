## üìù Conclusion

The current StepParser implementation provides a solid foundation with approximately 30% of the documented requirements implemented. The most critical gaps are in multi-path parsing, location tracking, and real-time operations. With focused development following the proposed roadmap, the implementation could achieve feature parity with the documentation within 4-5 months.

The immediate priority should be implementing GLR multi-path parsing and location tracking, as these are foundational capabilities required by most other advanced features.
