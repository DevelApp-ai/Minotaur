# C17 Grammar Specification

## Overview

This grammar specification provides comprehensive parsing support for the C17 programming language (ISO/IEC 9899:2018). It is designed for use in parser generators and language processing tools, offering complete coverage of the C17 standard.

## Language Version

- **Standard**: ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (C17)
- **Informal Name**: C17
- **Previous Standards**: C11, C99, C90
- **Release Date**: July 2018

## Features Covered

### Core Language Features
- ✅ Variable declarations and definitions
- ✅ Function declarations and definitions
- ✅ Struct and union types
- ✅ Enumeration types
- ✅ Pointer types and operations
- ✅ Array types (including VLAs)
- ✅ Control flow statements (if, switch, loops)
- ✅ Expression evaluation and operators
- ✅ Type casting and conversions

### C99 Features
- ✅ Variable Length Arrays (VLAs)
- ✅ Designated initializers
- ✅ Compound literals
- ✅ Flexible array members
- ✅ Inline functions
- ✅ `restrict` qualifier
- ✅ Mixed declarations and statements
- ✅ Complex number support
- ✅ Boolean type (`_Bool`)

### C11 Features
- ✅ Generic selections (`_Generic`)
- ✅ Static assertions (`_Static_assert`)
- ✅ Alignment specifiers (`_Alignas`, `_Alignof`)
- ✅ Thread-local storage (`_Thread_local`)
- ✅ Atomic operations (`_Atomic`)
- ✅ Anonymous structs and unions
- ✅ `_Noreturn` function specifier

### C17 Improvements
- ✅ Bug fixes and clarifications from C11
- ✅ Improved specification consistency
- ✅ Enhanced portability requirements

## Grammar Structure

The grammar is organized into the following major sections:

1. **Translation Unit**: Top-level program structure
2. **Declarations**: Variable and function declarations
3. **Statements**: Control flow and expression statements
4. **Expressions**: Operator precedence and associativity
5. **Types**: Complete type system including modern features
6. **Lexical Elements**: Tokens, identifiers, constants, and literals

## Usage Examples

### Basic Program Structure
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Modern C Features
```c
// Generic selection
#define TYPE_NAME(x) _Generic((x), \
    int: "int", \
    float: "float", \
    double: "double", \
    default: "unknown")

// Static assertion
_Static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "int must be at least 4 bytes");

// Atomic operations
#include <stdatomic.h>
_Atomic int counter = 0;

// Designated initializers
struct Point origin = {.x = 0.0, .y = 0.0};
```

## Parser Generator Compatibility

This grammar is designed to work with various parser generators:

- **ANTLR**: Compatible with ANTLR4 grammar format
- **Yacc/Bison**: Can be adapted to Yacc/Bison format
- **LALR(1)**: Grammar is LALR(1) compatible
- **Recursive Descent**: Suitable for recursive descent parsers

## Performance Characteristics

- **Grammar Size**: ~200 production rules
- **Parse Complexity**: O(n) for most constructs
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate (suitable for embedded systems)
- **Ambiguity**: Resolved through precedence and associativity rules

## Known Limitations

1. **Preprocessor**: This grammar does not handle C preprocessor directives
2. **Pragmas**: Compiler-specific pragmas are not included
3. **Extensions**: GCC/Clang extensions are not covered
4. **Comments**: Comment handling depends on lexer implementation

## Testing and Validation

The grammar has been tested with:

- ✅ Standard C library headers
- ✅ Real-world C projects
- ✅ C17 specification examples
- ✅ Edge cases and corner cases
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Import Grammar
```
import C17.grammar into your parser generator
```

### Step 2: Configure Lexer
```
Set TokenSplitter to Space
Configure keyword recognition
Set up identifier and literal patterns
```

### Step 3: Generate Parser
```
Generate parser with your preferred tool
Configure error handling and recovery
Set up AST generation if needed
```

### Step 4: Test
```
Test with provided examples
Validate against C17 test suite
Performance testing with real code
```
