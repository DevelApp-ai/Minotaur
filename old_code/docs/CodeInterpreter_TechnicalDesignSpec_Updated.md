# Technical Design Specification: Domain-Specific Language Designer and Parser

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a technical design specification for a domain-specific language (DSL) designer and parser system based on the CodeInterpreter project. The system is designed to create, parse, and interpret domain-specific languages using an enhanced Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) with regex-based tokenization. The system supports both defining new languages with `.grammar` files and extending existing languages with `.extension` files, enabling features such as embedding one language into another (e.g., SQL into C#).

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this system is to provide a flexible framework for:
- Defining domain-specific languages using grammar files
- Extending existing languages to support additional syntax
- Switching between different grammars during interpretation
- Detecting and resolving ambiguities in grammar definitions
- Compiling optimized parsers from developed grammars

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers the interpreter backend design, focusing on:
- Grammar file format and structure
- Lexer and parser implementation
- Grammar loading and switching mechanisms
- Ambiguity detection and resolution approach
- Cross-platform frontend requirements for visualization and debugging
- Technology stack preferences and implementation recommendations

## 2. Grammar Format Specification

### 2.1 Grammar File Structure

Grammar files use the `.grammar` extension and follow a specific structure:

```
Grammar: <GrammarName>
TokenSplitter: <SplitterType>

<rule definitions>
```

Where:
- `<GrammarName>` is the name of the grammar being defined or the grammar being used to interpret this grammar
- `<SplitterType>` can be:
  - `None`: No automatic token splitting (explicit whitespace handling)
  - `Space`: Space-based token splitting (implicit whitespace handling)
  - `"<regex>"`: A regex pattern for custom token splitting

### 2.2 Extension File Structure

Extension files use the `.extension` extension and follow this structure:

```
Extends Grammar: <BaseGrammarName>
Include: <IncludedGrammar1>, <IncludedGrammar2>, ...

<rule definitions>
```

Where:
- `<BaseGrammarName>` is the name of the grammar being extended
- `<IncludedGrammar1>, <IncludedGrammar2>, ...` are optional comma-separated grammar names to include

### 2.3 Rule Definition Syntax

Rules are defined using a BNF-like syntax:

```
<rule-name> ::= <expression>
```

Where:
- `<rule-name>` is the name of the rule enclosed in angle brackets
- `<expression>` is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, with alternatives separated by the vertical bar character `|`

#### 2.3.1 Core EBNF Grammar (CEBNF)

The system uses a core EBNF grammar (CEBNF) that defines the basic syntax for grammar files. This is defined in the `0001_CEBNF.grammar` file and includes rules for:
- Start symbols and end-of-file markers
- Rule definitions with names and expressions
- Literals and text handling
- Special characters and operators

#### 2.3.2 Modern BNF (MBNF)

The system also supports a Modern BNF (MBNF) format defined in `0004_MBNF.grammar` that adds:
- Explicit whitespace handling
- Regex as token definers for terminals
- Context modifiers for rules
- Explicit markup of non-terminals

### 2.4 Context Handling

The MBNF grammar supports context-sensitive parsing through context modifiers:

```
<rule name (context name)> ::= <expression>
```

Contexts can be switched on and off using code extensions:
- `Context(context name, on)`: Activates a specific context
- `Context(context name, off)`: Deactivates a specific context

### 2.5 Rule Activation Callbacks

To enable event-driven programming based on grammar rule matching, the grammar syntax will be extended to support rule activation callbacks:

```
<rule-name> ::= <expression> => { callback_function }
```

Where:
- `=>` indicates that a callback function should be executed when this rule is matched
- `callback_function` is the name of the function to be called

#### 2.5.1 Callback Function Specification

Callback functions can be defined with the following syntax:

```
<rule-name> ::= <expression> => { 
  function_name(match, context, position) 
}
```

Where:
- `function_name` is the name of the function to be called
- `match` is the matched text
- `context` is the current parsing context
- `position` is the position in the source code

#### 2.5.2 Callback Parameter Passing

Parameters can be passed to callback functions using the following syntax:

```
<rule-name> ::= <expression> => { 
  function_name($1, $2, $3) 
}
```

Where:
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` refer to the first, second, and third matched elements in the expression

#### 2.5.3 Conditional Callbacks

Callbacks can be conditionally executed using the following syntax:

```
<rule-name> ::= <expression> => { 
  if (condition) function_name($1) 
  else other_function($1) 
}
```

#### 2.5.4 Implementation Approach

The callback mechanism will be implemented by:
1. Extending the grammar parser to recognize the callback syntax
2. Creating a callback registry to store function references
3. Invoking registered callbacks when rules are matched during parsing
4. Providing a mechanism to register external callback functions

## 3. Interpreter Backend Design

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The interpreter backend consists of several key components:

1. **Grammar Container**: Manages multiple grammar definitions and their interpreters
2. **Grammar Loader**: Loads grammar files from disk or embedded resources
3. **Grammar Interpreter**: Builds grammar objects from loaded grammar files
4. **Lexer**: Tokenizes input based on grammar definitions
5. **Parser**: Parses tokenized input according to grammar rules
6. **Interpreter**: Coordinates the overall parsing and interpretation process

### 3.2 Component Relationships

                    └─────────────┘
```

### 3.3 Grammar Loading Process

1. The `GrammarLoader` loads grammar files from disk or embedded resources
2. Grammar files are parsed line by line, with the first line identifying the grammar name
3. The second line (optional) defines the token splitting mechanism
4. The remaining lines define the grammar rules
5. The `GrammarInterpreter` builds a `Grammar` object from the loaded grammar files
6. The `Grammar` object is added to the `GrammarContainer` for later use

### 3.4 Lexer Implementation

The lexer (`StepLexer`) is responsible for tokenizing input based on grammar definitions:

1. The lexer processes input character by character, creating tokens based on terminal definitions
2. It supports multiple lexer paths to handle ambiguities in tokenization
3. Each lexer path maintains its own state, including:
   - Current position in the input
   - Current token
   - Valid terminals at the current position
4. The lexer can merge lexer paths when ambiguities are resolved
5. Token splitting can be customized based on the grammar's `TokenSplitter` setting

### 3.5 Parser Implementation

The parser (`StepParser`) is responsible for parsing tokenized input according to grammar rules:

1. The parser processes tokens produced by the lexer
2. It maintains a set of active productions for each lexer path
3. When a token is received, the parser attempts to match it against active productions
4. The parser can split into multiple paths when ambiguities are encountered
5. Parser paths can be merged when ambiguities are resolved

## 4. Grammar Switching Mechanism

### 4.1 Grammar Container

The `GrammarContainer` is the central component for grammar switching:

1. It maintains a dictionary of loaded grammars and grammar interpreters
2. Grammars can be loaded from disk, embedded resources, or built programmatically
3. The container provides methods to retrieve grammars by name
4. When a grammar is requested but not found, the container attempts to load it

### 4.2 Context-Based Switching

Grammar switching can occur based on context:

1. Rules can be defined with context modifiers: `<rule name (context name)>`
2. Contexts can be activated or deactivated during parsing
3. When a context is active, only rules with matching context modifiers are considered
4. This allows for seamless switching between different grammar rules based on the parsing context

### 4.3 Extension-Based Switching

Grammar extensions provide another mechanism for switching:

1. Extension files can extend base grammars with additional rules
2. Extensions can include other grammars to incorporate their rules
3. When parsing with an extended grammar, the system can switch between base and extension rules
4. This enables embedding one language into another, such as SQL into C#

## 5. Ambiguity Detection Approach

### 5.1 Parser Splitting

The system uses a GLR parser-like approach to handle ambiguities:

1. When an ambiguity is detected (shift/reduce conflict), the parser splits into multiple paths
2. Each path represents a different interpretation of the input
3. All paths are processed in parallel
4. When a path reaches a point where it can no longer match the input, it is discarded
5. When multiple paths reach the same state, they can be merged

### 5.2 Lexer Path Management

The lexer also supports multiple paths to handle tokenization ambiguities:

1. When multiple terminals can match at a given position, the lexer creates multiple paths
2. Each path processes the input with a different terminal match
3. Paths that lead to invalid parses are eventually discarded
4. Paths that reach the same state can be merged to optimize processing

### 5.3 Ambiguity Resolution

The system provides several mechanisms for resolving ambiguities:

1. Terminal precedence: Terminals can be ordered by priority
2. Production specificity: More specific productions take precedence over general ones
3. Context constraints: Context modifiers can limit which rules apply in specific situations
4. First-match policy: When specified, only the first matching path is kept

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Core Classes

## 7. Optimization and Compilation

### 7.1 Parser Optimization

The system can be extended to compile optimized parsers from developed grammars:

1. Grammar definitions can be analyzed to identify and eliminate redundancies
2. State machines can be generated for efficient parsing
3. Look-ahead tables can be pre-computed to reduce runtime decision-making
4. Common subexpressions can be factored out to optimize parsing paths

### 7.2 Integration with Existing Parser Generators

The system can be integrated with existing parser generators like Bison or ANTLR:

1. Grammar definitions can be translated to formats compatible with these tools
2. Generated parsers can be incorporated into the system
3. This allows leveraging the optimization capabilities of established parser generators

## 9. Future Enhancements

### 9.1 Hybrid NFA/DFA Parsing Approach

A significant performance enhancement would be implementing a hybrid NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton) and DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) approach:

1. **NFA for Lexical Analysis**:
   - NFAs excel at pattern matching and efficiently handle complex regular expressions
   - They provide greater flexibility in recognizing patterns
   - Well-suited for the initial lexical analysis phase
   - Can handle ambiguous patterns through multiple possible transitions

2. **DFA for Parsing**:
   - DFAs are typically faster for parsing since they don't require backtracking
   - Each state has exactly one transition for each input symbol
   - More efficient execution with predictable performance characteristics
   - Lower memory overhead during parsing execution

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Use NFAs for the lexer component to handle complex token patterns
   - Convert NFAs to DFAs where possible for performance optimization
   - Implement a hybrid state machine that can switch between NFA and DFA modes
   - Use DFA for common, well-defined grammar constructs
   - Fall back to NFA for complex, ambiguous, or context-sensitive grammar sections

4. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Faster lexical analysis for complex patterns
   - More efficient parsing for deterministic grammar sections
   - Better overall performance for large grammars
   - Reduced memory consumption during parsing

5. **Integration with Existing System**:
   - Extend the current lexer to support NFA-based pattern matching
   - Implement DFA conversion algorithms for optimizable grammar sections
   - Add configuration options to control the NFA/DFA balance
   - Provide performance metrics to measure improvements

### 9.2 Advanced Frontend Features

Additional frontend features that can be implemented include:
- Collaborative editing of grammar definitions
- Version control integration
- Performance profiling and optimization tools
- Integration with IDEs and code editors

### 9.3 Backend Enhancements

Additional backend features that can be implemented include:
- Semantic analysis and code generation
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Incremental parsing for better performance
- Integration with existing language servers

## 10. Conclusion

This technical design specification provides a comprehensive overview of the domain-specific language designer and parser system, including both the interpreter backend and the cross-platform frontend. The system's modular architecture, flexible grammar definition format, sophisticated ambiguity handling, and interactive visualization capabilities make it a powerful tool for creating and working with domain-specific languages.

By implementing this design with React for web and desktop applications, TypeScript for cross-platform compatibility, rule activation callbacks for event-driven programming, and Blockly integration for visual grammar development, developers can create a modern, efficient system for defining, parsing, and interpreting domain-specific languages, with robust debugging and visualization capabilities across multiple platforms.
