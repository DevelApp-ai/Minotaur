# Golem Socratic Tutor Specification

## Overview
The Golem Socratic Tutor is an AI-powered, interactive learning system that uses the Socratic method to guide users through understanding Minotaur's grammar development concepts. Instead of presenting information directly, it asks probing questions to help users discover knowledge themselves.

## Core Philosophy
The Socratic method is based on the principle that learning occurs through guided questioning rather than direct instruction. The tutor:
- Asks thought-provoking questions to stimulate critical thinking
- Adapts questions based on user responses and understanding level
- Guides users to discover answers themselves rather than providing direct answers
- Builds understanding incrementally through a series of connected inquiries

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Questioning Engine
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Questions start simple and become more complex based on user responses
- **Context Awareness**: Questions relate to the user's current position in the learning journey
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual learning patterns and preferences
- **Multi-Path Learning**: Different question sequences based on user's background and goals

### 2. Interactive Dialogue System
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Maintains context across multiple question-answer cycles
- **Clarification Requests**: Asks follow-up questions when user responses are unclear
- **Encouragement and Hints**: Provides supportive feedback without giving away answers
- **Reflection Prompts**: Encourages users to think about what they've learned

### 3. Knowledge Assessment
- **Understanding Verification**: Validates comprehension through targeted questions
- **Gap Identification**: Identifies areas where additional questioning is needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors learning progress and adjusts difficulty accordingly
- **Concept Mastery**: Ensures users truly understand concepts before moving forward

### 4. Minotaur-Specific Learning Areas

#### Grammar Development Fundamentals
- What is a grammar and why do we need formal language definitions?
- How do cognitive graphs represent language structures differently than traditional grammars?
- What are the benefits of visual grammar development over text-based approaches?

#### Cognitive Graph Architecture
- How do nodes represent different language elements?
- What is the relationship between terminal and non-terminal nodes?
- How does the graph structure help us understand parsing processes?

#### StepParser Integration
- How does parsing transform text into structured representations?
- What role does the StepParser play in the Minotaur ecosystem?
- How can we troubleshoot parsing errors effectively?

#### Symbolic Analysis
- What insights can we gain from analyzing execution paths?
- How do constraints affect grammar behavior?
- What optimization opportunities exist in grammar structures?

#### Version Control for Grammars
- How do we manage changes to grammar definitions over time?
- What are the best practices for collaborative grammar development?
- How can we track the evolution of language specifications?

## Implementation Architecture

### SocraticTutorEngine
```csharp
public class SocraticTutorEngine
{
    // Core questioning logic
    Task<Question> GenerateNextQuestionAsync(UserContext context, string previousResponse);
    
    // Response analysis and adaptation
    Task<ResponseAnalysis> AnalyzeResponseAsync(string response, Question question);
    
    // Learning path management
    Task<LearningPath> AdaptLearningPathAsync(UserProgress progress);
    
    // Knowledge assessment
    Task<ConceptMastery> AssessUnderstandingAsync(string topic, List<QuestionResponse> history);
}
```

### Question Types
1. **Open-Ended Questions**: "What do you think happens when...?"
2. **Comparison Questions**: "How is X different from Y?"
3. **Cause-Effect Questions**: "Why do you think this error occurred?"
4. **Application Questions**: "How would you apply this concept to solve...?"
5. **Reflection Questions**: "What did you learn from this example?"
6. **Hypothesis Questions**: "What would happen if we changed...?"

### Response Analysis
- **Keyword Detection**: Identify key concepts in user responses
- **Confidence Assessment**: Determine user's confidence level
- **Misconception Identification**: Detect common misunderstandings
- **Depth Evaluation**: Assess the depth of user's reasoning

### Adaptive Behavior
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Increase/decrease question complexity based on performance
- **Topic Navigation**: Move to different topics based on user interests and needs
- **Hint Provision**: Offer progressively more specific hints when users struggle
- **Concept Reinforcement**: Revisit important concepts through different question angles

## User Experience Design

### Interface Elements
1. **Question Display**: Clear presentation of current question
2. **Response Input**: Natural text input for user responses
3. **Progress Indicator**: Visual representation of learning progress
4. **Hint System**: Progressive disclosure of helpful information
5. **Concept Map**: Visual representation of covered topics and relationships

### Interaction Flow
1. **Initial Assessment**: Determine user's starting knowledge level
2. **Guided Discovery**: Lead user through concept exploration via questions
3. **Knowledge Validation**: Confirm understanding through application questions
4. **Concept Integration**: Help user connect new knowledge to existing understanding
5. **Reflection and Summary**: Encourage reflection on the learning journey

### Personalization Features
- **Learning Style Adaptation**: Adjust question types based on user preferences
- **Pace Control**: Allow users to control the speed of progression
- **Interest Tracking**: Focus on topics that engage the user most
- **Previous Knowledge Integration**: Build upon user's existing programming experience

## Integration with Existing Tutorial System

### Enhancement Strategy
- **Parallel Operation**: Socratic tutor complements existing step-by-step tutorial
- **Seamless Transition**: Users can switch between tutorial modes
- **Progress Synchronization**: Learning progress is tracked across both systems
- **Context Sharing**: Both systems share user context and progress information

### Tutorial Mode Selection
- **Guided Tour**: Traditional step-by-step tutorial for quick overviews
- **Deep Exploration**: Socratic method for thorough understanding
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of both methods based on user preference
- **Contextual Recommendations**: System suggests appropriate mode based on user goals
