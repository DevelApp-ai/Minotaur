# Pipeline Consolidation Changes

## Overview
Consolidated duplicate CI/CD pipelines to resolve file duplication and prevent quality scans from targeting the deprecated `old_code` folder.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated CI/CD Pipelines
- **Removed**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (basic pipeline)
- **Enhanced**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd-enhanced.yml` (now the single CI/CD pipeline)
- **Result**: Eliminated pipeline duplication while preserving all functionality

### 2. Enhanced Pipeline Features
The consolidated pipeline now includes all features from both pipelines:

#### From Enhanced Pipeline (kept):
- GitVersion for semantic versioning
- Release management with prerelease support
- Automated NuGet publishing
- Advanced packaging and artifact management

#### From Basic Pipeline (integrated):
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Package vulnerability scanning, outdated package detection
- **Lint and Format Check**: Code formatting verification with `dotnet format`
- **Static Analysis**: Build with `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`
- **Performance Testing**: Demo application execution for performance baseline

### 3. Quality Scan Protection
- **Added**: `old_code/` to `.gitignore`
- **Purpose**: Prevent future quality scans from targeting deprecated legacy code
- **Note**: Current workflows already correctly target only `src/Minotaur.sln`

## Pipeline Jobs (Consolidated)

1. **calculate-version**: GitVersion semantic versioning
2. **build-and-test**: Build solution and run tests with coverage
3. **code-quality**: Security analysis and package scanning
4. **lint-and-format**: Code formatting and static analysis
5. **performance-test**: Performance baseline testing
6. **package**: NuGet package creation
7. **prerelease**: Automated prerelease publishing
8. **release**: Production release publishing
9. **cleanup**: Artifact cleanup

## Verification
- ✅ Build and test functionality preserved (56 tests passing)
- ✅ Code quality checks working (formatting, security, static analysis)
- ✅ Performance testing functional
- ✅ No quality scans targeting `old_code` folder
- ✅ Enhanced pipeline includes all original basic pipeline features

## Benefits
- **Eliminates Pipeline Duplication**: Single source of truth for CI/CD
- **Preserves All Functionality**: No loss of quality checks or automation
- **Prevents Future Issues**: Protection against `old_code` scanning
- **Better Organization**: Clearer workflow dependencies and structure
